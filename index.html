  				<p>
  					I am a very dynamic person so I always have to do something to canalise my energy. I am passionated by many things, some of them are : music because I can express my feeling, cooking so I can keep myself focused and reading to relax and keep calm.

  		<h2>Music</h2>
  			<p>
  				Music has always been the center of my life. Indeed I started playing the violin aged 5 in a very strict music school that obliged us to also practice our solfeo so we can say that musical practice was occupying a lot of my time. That is how I developed my musical taste. Later on, I discovered that if I loved playing the violin, something I liked even more was singing so I started lessons to get better stil in the same school, got my final diploma from it, and now that Iâ€™m free, I have never loved music so much. I cannot spend a day not listening and playing music, it makes me escape from small problems I can encounter and makes me feel good. In fact music simply is my heaven on earth.

  		<h2>Cooking</h2>
  			<p>
  				Cooking is something I started to experiment with my family as I have Jewish origins, food has a huge cultural importance to me. In my spirit, cooking is associated to good things, big family parties so this is why I love cooking so much. More over, I sometimes have difficulties concentrating and following a receepe, step by step obliges me to stay focused.

  		<h2>Reading</h2>
  			<p>
  				Sometimes I just feel like I am too excited and the only way for me to canalise this energy, at the end of the day, before going to sleep for exemple is to read a good thriller, it makes me calm myself and improve my spelling, as spelling mistakes are something I hate doing, reading is the key to improve a language. It is a calm intellectual activity which allows me to be mentally very active but physically resting.
